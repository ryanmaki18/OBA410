# OBA 410 (Operations & Business Analytics)

Data Analytics in Python -- Taked at Lindquist College of Business @ The University of Oregon (F22)

The focus of this course is on Python and its application to data analytics. Python is the most popular programming language for data science; therefore, our objective is to teach programming fundamentals in this 
language. Major data analytics libraries in Python will be discussed in this course. These libraries are Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
  
This course introduces the basics concepts of data analytics, and the audiences of this course are senior undergraduate, Master's, and MBA students. Data analytics is one of the most popular fields in business. Analyzing 
historical data and applying various statistical and machine learning techniques enables us to develop models that can be used in different classification and pattern recognition problems such as credit card fraud 
detection, disease diagnosis, and predicting the success rate of a marketing campaign, among numerous other applications.
  
In this course, the main concepts of various techniques such as k-nearest neighbors, linear regression, logistic regression, lasso, ridge, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine are introduced. In this 
course, theoretical concepts of data analytics will be fortified by applying them to real datasets.
  
Students who successfully complete this course will:  
• Be able to use Python programming language and its data analytics library  
• Be able to analyze data and develop predictive analytics models using Python  
• Be able to establish the thinking process of defining and developing a real-world data-driven analytics project  
• Learn the fundamentals of different data analytics techniques and how to implement them  
• Learn how to evaluate various models and select the best model
